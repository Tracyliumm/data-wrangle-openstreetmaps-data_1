San Francisco, in northern California, is a city on the tip of a peninsula surrounded by the Pacific 
Ocean and San Francisco Bay. It's known for its hilly landscape, year-round fog, iconic Golden Gate 
Bridge, cable cars and colorful Victorian houses. It is the only consolidated city-county in California 
and encompasses a land area of about 46.9 square miles (121 km2) on the northern end of the San Francisco 
Peninsula, giving it a density of about 18,187 people per square mile (7,022 people per km2). 
It is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in the state of California 
and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City.
San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego and San Jose, 
and the 14th-most populous city in the United States—with a Census-estimated 2014 population of 852,469.
The city and its surroundings are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, part of the San Jose-San 
Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated 
population of 8.6 million.

The reason I choose San Francisco for the study is because it is my favorite city and I live close by.
